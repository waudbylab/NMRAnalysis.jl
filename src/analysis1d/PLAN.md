# 1D Analysis Framework — Design & Implementation Plan

This document captures the design agreed in discussion for a unified 1D analysis
framework, and tracks implementation status.

## Philosophy

Many lightweight tools for particular analyses. Make 90% of the most common work
easier to use; leave the 10% (full lineshape deconvolution, CORCEMA-ST, numerical
Bloch–McConnell, NUS) alone. Each experiment should be a *thin composition* over
shared machinery, not a bespoke script.

## The core idea

Every 1D-derived analysis is **a collection of 1D traces, each tagged with values
of one or more arrayed variables**, reduced to quantities over named regions, then
fitted against an evolution parameter (or contrasted between categorical slices).

The differences between experiments are confined to three composition slots plus an
optional global post-fit:

1. **Reduction** — region × planes → named quantity series. v1: `Integrate` (a height
   is just a zero-width region; nutation needs no special case). Future: NMF for kinetics.
2. **Series model** — quantity vs evolution parameter → derived parameters. Two shapes:
   - **curve-fit** (continuous axis): exponential, recovery, damped sinusoid, …
   - **contrast** (categorical slices): STD = (I_ref − I_sat)/I_ref, waterLOGSY sign.
     (1D analogue of the existing `hetnoe2d` reference/saturated experiment.)
3. **Visualisation strategy** — usually derived from the series model; overridable.

Plus:

- **Global post-fit** (`postprocess`) — combine series into a derived result
  (TRACT τc from ΔR₂; STD epitope normalisation). Returns a scalar/table shown inline,
  or — where it is an interactive model fit (exchange) — drives a second window.
- **Noise region and the region list are universal** and live in the shared base.

## Data model

- `Trace(δ, y)` — one 1D spectrum: chemical-shift axis + intensities. Pure; no NMRData
  dependency, so the whole analysis layer is testable headless.
- `Planes(traces, vars)` — long format: one row per spectrum, `vars[i]` a `NamedTuple`
  of the arrayed variables (`:time`, `:which`, `:sat`, `:tsat`, `:run`, …). The name is
  `planes`, echoing the 2D `plane`/`slice`/`nslices` vocabulary.
- `Region(label, lo, hi)` — a named ppm interval; `lo == hi` ⇒ height.
- `Dataset1D(planes, noise)` — the planes plus the universal noise region.

Series = group plane indices by all `vars` columns except the fit-axis. This generalises
R1ρ's `onresseries` to arbitrary coordinates; TRACT groups by `:which`, kinetics by `:run`.

## Reactivity / GUI substrate (later phases)

- Keep the **science pure** (functions over `Trace`/`Planes`), Observables/ComputeGraph
  only at the GUI edge. Cost decides the binding: cheap/live derivations are reactive;
  the expensive, judgement-bearing fit (exchange) is button-triggered.
- Adopt Makie's **ComputeGraph (compute pipeline)** as the substrate for the *new* 1D
  GUI — lazy, cached, consistently resolved — which removes the eager-recompute and
  `fit_generation`-counter pains seen in GUI2D. Prototype it on the Tier-2 exchange popup
  first (highest value, new code, contained blast radius); migrate Window 1 if it pays off.
- Two windows: Window 1 = spectral overlay + auto-sliders (one per `vars` column with >1
  value) + region list + live Tier-1 result panel. Window 2 (opt-in per experiment) =
  exchange/global model fit. Both are views onto the same nodes; only the Fit button runs
  the heavy solve.

## Relationship to GUI2D

1D is GUI2D with the entire lineshape-fitting layer removed (no clustering, masking,
simulation, or threaded cancellable fit — reduction is just integration) and a
coordinate/second-window layer added. Reused wholesale: the `Parameter` idea, the
`models.jl` parametric-model pattern, the `postfit!`/`postfitglobal!` hooks, the
`VisualisationStrategy` trait + composition, state-as-reactive-nodes, `summaryplot`.
Genuinely new: `planes` (multi-axis navigation) and the exchange second window.

Module layout deliberately mirrors GUI2D so a shared `AnalysisCore` can later be lifted
out of both (start parallel, refactor toward shared core once 1D is proven).

## Experiments (this iteration)

| experiment | regions | plane vars | fit-axis | group | reduction | series model | global |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| relaxation | 1 | `time` | `time` | – | Integrate | Exponential / Recovery | – |
| TRACT | 1 | `time, which` | `time` | `which` | Integrate | Exponential ×2 | τc(ΔR₂) inline |
| nutation | 1 | `duration` | `duration` | – | Integrate | DampedSinusoid | 90° pulse |
| STD | N named | `sat, tsat` | `tsat` | `sat` | Integrate | Contrast (+ buildup) | epitope |
| kinetics | N named | `time, run` | `time` | `run` | Integrate | NoFitting (v1) | – |

### STD details

STD is the richest case and is designed for:
- minimal: reference + one saturation, single `tsat` → STD% per region.
- multiple saturation frequencies (`sat ∈ {reference, methyl, aromatic, …}`) → STD% per
  (region, sat), each non-reference category contrasted against the reference at matching `tsat`.
- buildup: multiple `tsat` → fit STD-AF(tsat) = STD-AF_max·(1 − exp(−k·tsat)) per
  (region, sat); report the **initial slope** STD-AF₀ = STD-AF_max·k (removes T1 bias).
- epitope: normalise STD% across regions to the strongest → relative %.

Leave alone (10%): CORCEMA-ST relaxation-matrix epitope quantification.

## Implementation status

Phase 1 — **pure analysis core + 5 experiments (headless, tested)**  ← THIS ITERATION
- [x] `Trace` / `Planes` / `Region` / `Dataset1D`
- [x] `Integrate` reduction with noise propagation (Measurements), height = zero width
- [x] series models: Exponential, Recovery, DampedSinusoid, NoFitting; Contrast (STD)
- [x] grouping + curve-fit pipeline (noise-weighted) → `SeriesResult`
- [x] experiments: Relaxation, TRACT (τc), Nutation (90°), STD (multi-freq + buildup + epitope), Kinetics
- [x] NMRData → Dataset1D loaders (thin adapters)
- [x] synthetic-data unit tests (run once Julia is available)

Phase 2 — interactive GUI (Window 1): overlay, auto-sliders, region list, live Tier-1,
ComputeGraph substrate, CairoMakie export, dispatch registration.

Phase 3 — Tier-2 exchange second window + `ExchangeModel`; R1ρ (on/off-res), CEST, CPMG
onto this framework; combined/global exchange fitting.

Phase 4 — additional reductions (NMF kinetics), diffusion, qNMR/PULCON, temperature cal;
lift shared `AnalysisCore` out of GUI2D + GUI1D.
